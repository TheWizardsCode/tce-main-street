# Main Street: UX, Visual, Animation, and Audio Notes

## Scope

This document captures the current implementation-level guidance for Main Street UI feedback polish in Milestone 4.

## Event Feedback Animations

### Card transfer feedback (market -> destination)

- Trigger: when buying cards from the market.
- Behavior:
  - Businesses animate from the market row to the selected street slot.
  - Investment events animate from the market row to the player hand.
  - Upgrades animate from the market row to the upgraded street slot.
- Accessibility: transfer animation is skipped when Reduced Motion is enabled.

### Resource pop feedback (coins / reputation)

- Trigger: whenever HUD coin or reputation value changes.
- Helper: `popTextOrIcon()` from `src/ui/popTextOrIcon.ts`.
- Timing target: ~1500ms (~1.5 seconds).
- Motion: upward rise + fade + scale pop.
- Non-blocking: animation runs asynchronously and does not block game logic flow.

Example:

```ts
void popTextOrIcon({
  scene: this,
  target: deltaText,
  duration: 1500,
  riseY: 22,
  scale: 1.2,
  reducedMotion: this.settingsPanel?.reducedMotion,
});
```

### End-of-turn income collection (coin fly-to-HUD)

- Trigger: `MainStreetTurnController.endTurn()` after `processEndOfTurn()`
  resolves with `income.total > 0` (CG-0MSRGTUSK003GDGE).
- Helper: `MainStreetAnimator.animateIncomeCollection()` — launches one coin
  icon per producing street slot (from `IncomeResult.breakdown`) that arcs to
  the HUD coins counter, plus one reputation pip per rep-earning card to the
  reputation HUD value.
- SFX: staggered `SFX_KEYS.COIN_POP` (`sfx-coin-pop`) per flight, played via
  the scene `SoundManager` through `moveGameObject`'s `sfx.start`.
- Landing: when every flight completes, a final `+total` pop
  (`popTextOrIcon`) lands at the coin counter. While collection is running
  (`scene.incomeCollectionActive === true`) the immediate HUD delta pop is
  suppressed so the final pop is the single landing feedback — the income
  sound/event routing (`income-gained` → `sfx-income-positive`) still runs.
- Timing budget: flights run inside the existing 400ms → 800ms turn-advance
  window (600ms flight, 50ms stagger — ≤1050ms for a full 10-slot street),
  so turn timing is unchanged and the effect is non-blocking.
- Accessibility (reduced motion): flights are skipped entirely; the HUD
  refresh path still provides the single final pop + income sound.
- Headless/replay exemption (AGENTS.md rule 8): presentation-only — never
  mutates state or transcript; returns immediately in replay/headless mode
  (`scene.replayMode`), no rendering or audio.
- Reuse: `moveGameObject` + `SoundManager` + `popTextOrIcon`, `SFX_KEYS`
  (`COMMON_SFX_KEYS` convention); no new SFX keys or engine infrastructure.

### Market deal-in (day-start refill / Discover / Research swap)

- Helper: `MainStreetAnimator.animateMarketDealIn()`.
- Trigger points (`MainStreetTurnController`):
  - `startDayPhase()` — after the final (post-prewarm) market render, both
    the development and investments rows deal in. Skipped on checkpoint
    resume (`skipMarketRefill`), where the saved market is preserved.
  - `onRefreshDevelopmentClick()` / `onRefreshInvestmentsClick()` — after a
    successful Discover/Research, the outgoing row cards fade/shrink out from
    their old slot positions (snapshot visuals via `createTransferCardVisual`)
    while the incoming row deals in.
- Behavior:
  - Incoming cards enter a "dealt" state synchronously in the same frame as
    the draw (scale 0.6, alpha 0.35, raised 24px — no flicker), then tween
    to full size/opacity with a staggered 80ms launch per card.
  - Each incoming card plays the shared deal SFX (`SFX_KEYS.DEAL`) via the
    scene `SoundManager` at launch.
  - Outgoing snapshots launch first (60ms stagger) and fade/shrink out over
    300ms, then are destroyed.
- Source positions: `MainStreetRenderer.getMarketSlotCenter()` mirrors
  `drawMarketRow`'s layout math; the rendered cards themselves come from
  `MainStreetRenderer.getMarketRowCards()` (rebuilt every `refreshMarket`).
- Accessibility: animation is skipped when Reduced Motion is enabled (cards
  appear instantly).
- Headless/replay exemption: returns immediately in replay/headless mode
  (`replayMode`) — presentation-only, never mutates game state or the
  transcript, and never blocks the turn flow.

## Scene Transitions

- Main Street scene-level fade transitions are currently disabled.
- The reusable helper `runSceneTransition()` remains available in `src/ui/sceneTransition.ts` for future use once the fade issue is addressed.

## Accessibility

### Reduced motion

A `Reduced Motion` toggle is available in the Settings panel.

- Storage key: `tce-ui-reduced-motion`
- Behavior:
  - resource pop animations are skipped
  - scene transitions are skipped
- Helpers also respect OS `prefers-reduced-motion` when no explicit override is provided.

## Asset pipeline notes

- Current implementation uses existing SVG card placeholders.
- Animation helpers are asset-agnostic and will accept final art replacements without API changes.
